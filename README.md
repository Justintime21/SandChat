This project was created with the help of a guidance and even with that i did run into a pretty big problem of CORS policy. Although i wrote the whole code i wasnt able to execute it because of the said CORS policy.
I did try the CORS unblock extension but even with that it didnt execute. The node server kept crashing. I do have a lot of comments explaning most of the lines of code in the project. 
But the guidance i was taking of was able to execute his project.(he didnt run into the CORS policy issue)
